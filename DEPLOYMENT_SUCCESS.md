## 🎓 WHAT LOVABLE IMPROVED

### Enhanced SEO Component
Lovable made the SEO component more flexible:

**Before:**
```typescript
<SEO
  title="Page Title"
  description="Description"
  schema={schemas}
/>
```

**After (Still Works + New Options):**
```typescript
<SEO
  title="Page Title"
  description="Description"
  schema={schemas}
  // NEW: Additional flexibility
  includeOrganizationSchema={true}
  publishedTime="2024-11-25"
  modifiedTime="2024-11-25"
/>
```

This maintains backward compatibility while adding new features!
