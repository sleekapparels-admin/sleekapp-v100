## High-Level Deployment Topology

The sleekapp-v100 deployment topology consists of a decoupled frontend and backend architecture. The frontend is a static site generated by Vite that can be hosted on multiple platforms including Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting. The backend services are provided by Supabase, which hosts the PostgreSQL database, authentication system, storage buckets, and serverless Edge Functions.

The frontend communicates with the Supabase backend through the Supabase JavaScript client library, using HTTPS for all API calls. Static assets are served through the hosting provider's CDN, while dynamic data is retrieved from Supabase. The architecture follows a Jamstack pattern, with pre-rendered pages for SEO optimization and client-side hydration for interactive features.

The system is designed with multiple environments: development, staging, and production. Each environment has isolated Supabase projects to prevent data contamination. The production environment uses Lovable Cloud for hosting, with auto-deployment enabled from the main branch. The staging environment is used for testing new features, while development environments are used for individual feature development.

## Frontend Hosting Options

The sleekapp-v100 frontend can be hosted on multiple platforms, providing flexibility and redundancy. The primary production hosting is on Lovable Cloud, but the application is configured to work seamlessly with Vercel, Netlify, and Firebase Hosting.

### Vercel Configuration

The Vercel configuration is minimal, with a simple rewrite rule that routes all requests to index.html, enabling client-side routing:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

This configuration ensures that all routes are handled by the React application, allowing for client-side navigation while maintaining clean URLs.

### Netlify Configuration

The netlify.toml file contains comprehensive configuration for optimal performance and security:

```toml
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.html"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate"

[[headers]]
  for = "/assets/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

The configuration includes security headers to prevent common web vulnerabilities, aggressive caching for static assets to improve performance, and rewrite rules for client-side routing.

### Firebase Hosting Configuration

The firebase.json configuration provides similar functionality:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "dist",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ],
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "**/*.@(jpg|jpeg|gif|png|svg|webp|ico)",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Cache-Control",
            "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "source": "**/*.@(js|css)",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Cache-Control",
            "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This configuration specifies the build output directory, ignores certain files from deployment, sets up rewrites for client-side routing, and applies caching headers to static assets.

All hosting configurations ensure that the application is served with proper security headers, optimized caching, and correct routing for the React application.

## Supabase Backend Hosting

The backend of sleekapp-v100 is hosted on Supabase, which provides a comprehensive suite of backend services including a PostgreSQL database, authentication, storage, and serverless Edge Functions. The Supabase project is configured with specific settings for security, performance, and functionality.

### Supabase Project Configuration

The Supabase project is identified by the project_id in the config.toml file:

```toml
project_id = "eqpftggctumujhutomom"
```

This project ID corresponds to the Supabase URL: https://eqpftggctumujhutomom.supabase.co

### Edge Functions Configuration

The config.toml file contains configuration for various Edge Functions, specifying whether JWT verification is required:

```toml
[functions.send-resource-email]
verify_jwt = false

[functions.generate-invoice]
verify_jwt = true

[functions.bootstrap-admin]
verify_jwt = false

[functions.ai-design-generator]
verify_jwt = true
```

This configuration ensures that sensitive functions require authentication while public functions (like sending resource emails) can be called without authentication. The functions that require JWT verification are typically those that modify data or access sensitive information, while functions that perform public operations do not require authentication.

The Edge Functions architecture allows for serverless execution of backend logic, reducing infrastructure costs and improving scalability. Functions are written in TypeScript and deployed to Supabase's Edge Runtime, which provides low-latency execution close to users.

The functions cover a wide range of functionality including AI-powered features (ai-design-generator, ai-supplier-assignment), business processes (generate-invoice, create-payment-intent), and system operations (log-audit-action, log-security-event).

## Database Deployment

The database for sleekapp-v100 is a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase, with a comprehensive schema designed for a B2B marketplace. The database schema includes tables for users, suppliers, products, orders, and various marketplace features.

### Database Schema

The core of the marketplace system is the marketplace_products table, which stores product listings from suppliers:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS marketplace_products (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  supplier_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES suppliers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  product_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  subcategory TEXT,
  slug TEXT UNIQUE,
  base_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  platform_fee_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 10.00,
  platform_fee_amount DECIMAL(10,2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (base_price * platform_fee_percentage / 100) STORED,
  final_price DECIMAL(10,2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (base_price + (base_price * platform_fee_percentage / 100)) STORED,
  available_quantity INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  moq INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 50,
  unit TEXT DEFAULT 'pieces',
  reserved_quantity INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  images TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
  primary_image TEXT,
  video_url TEXT,
  sizes TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
  colors TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
  material TEXT,
  gsm INTEGER,
  fabric_composition TEXT,
  specifications JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  lead_time_days INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  shipping_from TEXT,
  shipping_weight_kg DECIMAL(10,2),
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'draft' CHECK (status IN ('draft', 'pending_approval', 'approved', 'rejected', 'sold_out', 'archived')),
  rejection_reason TEXT,
  admin_feedback TEXT,
  quality_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0 CHECK (quality_score >= 0 AND quality_score <= 100),
  approval_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
  approved_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  views INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  inquiries INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  sales INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  rating DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
  meta_keywords TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
  meta_description TEXT,
  is_featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  featured_until TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  published_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  CONSTRAINT positive_price CHECK (base_price > 0),
  CONSTRAINT positive_quantity CHECK (available_quantity >= 0)
);
```

The table includes comprehensive fields for product information, pricing, inventory, media, specifications, logistics, status, and engagement metrics. It uses PostgreSQL features like UUID primary keys, array columns for multiple values, JSONB for flexible specifications, generated columns for calculated values, and check constraints for data integrity.

### Database Indexes

The database includes multiple indexes to optimize query performance:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_marketplace_products_supplier ON marketplace_products(supplier_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_marketplace_products_status ON marketplace_products(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_marketplace_products_category ON marketplace_products(category);
CREATE INDEX idx_marketplace_products_approved ON marketplace_products(status, approval_date DESC) WHERE status = 'approved';
CREATE INDEX idx_marketplace_products_featured ON marketplace_products(is_featured, featured_until) WHERE is_featured = true;
CREATE INDEX idx_marketplace_products_price ON marketplace_products(final_price);
CREATE INDEX idx_marketplace_products_search ON marketplace_products USING gin(to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || COALESCE(description, '')));
```

These indexes support efficient queries by supplier, status, category, approval status, featured products, price, and full-text search.

### Database Migrations and Seeding

The database schema is managed through Supabase migrations, with SQL files in the supabase/migrations directory. The initial schema is defined in 20250122000000_create_marketplace_system.sql.

Sample data is provided in seed_READY_TO_RUN.sql, which includes sample users, suppliers, and other data for testing and demonstration purposes. The seeding process is designed to be idempotent, using ON CONFLICT clauses to handle existing data.

## CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

The CI/CD pipeline for sleekapp-v100 is configured to provide automated testing, building, and deployment of the application. The pipeline is designed to ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and enable rapid deployment of new features.

### Build Process

The build process is configured in package.json with the following scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "build:dev": "vite build --mode development",
  "lint": "eslint .",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}
```

The build process uses Vite to create optimized production assets, including minified JavaScript and CSS, code splitting, and asset optimization. The build output is a static site that can be deployed to any static hosting platform.

### Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration, validated by the env-validator.ts module:

```typescript
interface EnvConfig {
  VITE_SUPABASE_URL: string;
  VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: string;
}
```

The environment validator checks for the presence and validity of required environment variables at application startup, ensuring that the application cannot run without proper configuration.

### Deployment Automation

The production deployment is automated through Lovable Cloud, with auto-deployment enabled from the main branch. When changes are pushed to the main branch, the CI/CD pipeline automatically:

1. Installs dependencies
2. Runs linting and type checking
3. Builds the application
4. Runs tests
5. Deploys to production

The deployment process is designed to be fast and reliable, with a typical build time of 48 seconds. The output is approximately 600kb compressed (3.5MB raw), with Brotli compression enabled for optimal performance.

### Deployment Verification

After deployment, the system automatically verifies the deployment status, checking for:
- HTTP 200 responses for all pages
- Valid SSL/HTTPS configuration
- Proper rendering of all components
- Functionality of interactive features

The DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md document provides a comprehensive status overview, including build status, production deployment status, SEO page status, sitemap and indexing status, structured data status, and content status.

## Environment Setup

The environment setup for sleekapp-v100 is designed to support multiple environments (development, staging, production) with appropriate configuration for each.

### Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables:

- VITE_SUPABASE_URL: The URL of the Supabase project
- VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: The publishable API key for Supabase

These variables are validated at runtime by the env-validator.ts module, which checks for their presence and basic validity. In production, the application will fail to start if these variables are missing or invalid.

### Development Environment

The development environment is configured for local development with hot reloading and development-specific features. Developers can start the application with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the Vite development server with hot module replacement, allowing for rapid development.

### Production Environment

The production environment is configured for optimal performance and security. The Vite configuration includes:

```typescript
'import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL': JSON.stringify(process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL ?? 'https://eqpftggctumujhutomom.supabase.co'),
'import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY': JSON.stringify(process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY ?? 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImVxcGZ0Z2djdHVtdWpodXRvbW9tIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NjMxNjc5NzAsImV4cCI6MjA3ODc0Mzk3MH0.7KkuzAPJlU7PR6lOIKi_zZi31oUhWk_MGUzYhxGYehw'),
```

These defaults ensure that the application can run even if environment variables are not set, though production deployments should always set explicit values.

### Supabase Client Configuration

The Supabase client is configured in src/integrations/supabase/client.ts:

```typescript
export const supabase = createClient<Database>(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, {
  auth: {
    storage: localStorage,
    persistSession: true,
    autoRefreshToken: true,
  }
});
```

This configuration enables session persistence and automatic token refresh, providing a seamless authentication experience for users.

- [src/integrations/supabase/client.ts](file://src/integrations/supabase/client.ts#L1-L20)

## Deployment Processes

The deployment processes for sleekapp-v100 are designed to be reliable, repeatable, and automated. The system supports multiple deployment targets with consistent processes across environments.

### Production Deployment

The production deployment process is fully automated through Lovable Cloud:

1. Code is pushed to the main branch
2. CI/CD pipeline is triggered
3. Dependencies are installed
4. Code is linted and type-checked
5. Application is built with Vite
6. Tests are run
7. Static assets are deployed to Lovable Cloud
8. DNS is updated if necessary
9. Deployment is verified

The production deployment is monitored for success, with alerts configured for any failures. The deployment process typically takes less than 5 minutes from code push to live site.

### Staging Deployment

The staging deployment process is similar to production but uses a separate Supabase project and domain. Staging deployments are typically triggered manually or through a separate branch (e.g., staging) to allow for testing before production deployment.

### Database Deployment

Database changes are deployed through Supabase migrations. The process involves:

1. Creating a migration SQL file
2. Testing the migration locally
3. Committing the migration file
4. Applying the migration to the target environment

The setup-database.js script provides a framework for database setup, though it notes that DDL statements cannot be executed directly through the Supabase JS client. Instead, migrations must be run through the Supabase SQL Editor.

### Rollback Procedures

Rollback procedures are available for both frontend and backend:

- Frontend rollbacks can be performed through the hosting platform's deployment history
- Database rollbacks require restoring from backups or applying reverse migrations

The system is designed to be resilient to deployment issues, with health checks and monitoring in place to detect problems quickly.

## Monitoring & Logging

The monitoring and logging strategy for sleekapp-v100 is designed to provide comprehensive visibility into system health, performance, and errors.

### Error Tracking

The system includes multiple layers of error tracking:

- Client-side error boundaries in React components
- Global error handling
- Supabase function logging
- Security event logging

The ErrorBoundary component provides graceful error handling for React components, preventing the entire application from crashing due to a single component failure.

### Performance Monitoring

Performance is monitored through multiple mechanisms:

- Core Web Vitals tracking
- Page load timing
- API response times
- Build performance metrics

The useCoreWebVitals hook provides monitoring of key performance metrics, while the performanceMonitor utility tracks various performance indicators.

### System Health Checks

The system includes health check endpoints and monitoring:

- Frontend health checks through page availability
- Backend health checks through Supabase status
- Database connectivity checks
- Function availability checks

The SystemHealthCheck component provides a UI for monitoring system health, while automated health checks run periodically to ensure system availability.

### Logging

Logging is implemented through multiple mechanisms:

- Console logging in development
- Supabase function logs
- Security event logs
- Audit action logs

The logger.ts and securityLogger.ts modules provide structured logging for functions, with different log levels and formats for different types of events.

## Scaling Considerations

The architecture of sleekapp-v100 is designed to scale to handle increased user load, database growth, and AI processing demands.

### Frontend Scaling

The frontend is a static site that can be easily scaled through CDN distribution. The static assets are served from the hosting provider's global CDN, providing low-latency access to users worldwide. The Jamstack architecture ensures that the frontend can handle high traffic volumes with minimal infrastructure costs.

### Backend Scaling

The backend services are provided by Supabase, which automatically scales to handle increased load. The PostgreSQL database can be upgraded to larger plans as needed, and Supabase provides read replicas for improved read performance.

### Database Scaling

The database schema is designed with scalability in mind:

- Proper indexing for query performance
- Normalized structure to reduce data duplication
- JSONB columns for flexible data storage
- Array columns for efficient storage of multiple values

As the database grows, additional indexes can be added, and the database can be upgraded to a larger plan. For very large datasets, data archiving strategies can be implemented to move older data to cheaper storage.

### AI Processing Scaling

The AI processing demands are handled through Supabase Edge Functions, which can be scaled independently. The AI functions (ai-design-generator, ai-supplier-assignment, etc.) are designed to be stateless and can be executed in parallel. As AI processing demands increase, the function timeout and memory limits can be adjusted, and the functions can be optimized for performance.

### Caching Strategy

The system employs multiple levels of caching:

- CDN caching for static assets (1 year)
- Browser caching for HTML (no cache)
- Database query caching through Supabase
- Application-level caching for frequently accessed data

The caching strategy is designed to minimize server load while ensuring data freshness.

The development environment can run on a standard laptop or desktop computer.

### Production Environment

The production environment requirements are minimal due to the Jamstack architecture:

- Static hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, Firebase, or similar)
- Supabase project for backend services
- Domain name with DNS configuration
- SSL certificate (provided automatically by hosting platforms)

The static hosting requirements are minimal, as the site consists of static files that can be served from any web server or CDN.

### Supabase Requirements

The Supabase project requirements depend on the scale of the application:

- Free tier: Suitable for development and small production sites
- Pro tier: Recommended for production sites with moderate traffic
- Enterprise tier: Required for high-traffic sites with large databases

The specific requirements depend on factors such as:
- Number of monthly active users
- Database size
- API request volume
- Storage requirements
- Function execution time

### Bandwidth and Storage

The bandwidth and storage requirements are optimized:

- Static assets are minified and compressed (Brotli)
- Images are optimized and served in WebP format
- Video content is stored in the public/videos directory
- User-generated content is stored in Supabase storage buckets

The system is designed to minimize bandwidth usage while providing a rich user experience.
